These areas would be so identified where S&T intervention could significantly improve the existing socio-economic conditions. Demonstration and Field trials of socially relevant technologies would specially be encouraged. Interaction between State S&T Councils in similar ecological zone has been initiated and would be promoted further in future to facilitate joint S&T Programme formulation.<br><br>
DST would welcome proposals having clearly established linkages of S&T to overall development of the state.
